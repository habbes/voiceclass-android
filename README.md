# voiceclass-android
Android client for detecting gender and age group in recorded voice

## Server

To use the app, you will need to setup to clone and setup the server hosted in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/habbes/voiceclass-server). You will also need to modify the `BASE_URL` in the `MainActivity.java` class and set it to the url of your hosted server. The server also exposes an API that you can use without the Android app.
